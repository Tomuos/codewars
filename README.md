# Codewars

Welcome to the Codewars repository! This repository contains my solutions to various CodeWars coding challenges. I will be adding solutions to CodeWars challenges whenever possible. The folders in this repository are organized based on the difficulty level of the challenges, indicated by their corresponding "Kyu" ratings.

## Difficulty Levels

For those who are unfamiliar with CodeWars, the difficulty level of each challenge is indicated by its "Kyu" 🥋 rating. The Kyu ratings range from 8 Kyu to 1 Kyu, with 8 Kyu being the easiest and 1 Kyu being the most difficult. The Kyu ratings are based on the following criteria:

In CodeWars, the Kyu ratings are inverted, meaning that a lower number indicates a higher difficulty level. Here's a brief explanation of the Kyu ratings:

- 8 Kyu: Beginner level challenges, suitable for those who are new to programming. 👶
- 7 Kyu: Slightly more challenging problems, requiring some programming knowledge and skills. 👦
- 6 Kyu: Intermediate level challenges, involving more complex logic and problem-solving techniques. 🏃
- 5 Kyu: Advanced level challenges, suitable for experienced programmers. 💪
- 4 Kyu: Hard challenges that often require advanced algorithms and data structures. 😓
- 3 Kyu: Very hard challenges, requiring a deep understanding of programming concepts. 😱
- 2 Kyu: Extremely difficult challenges, suitable for advanced programmers and algorithm experts. 😡
- 1 Kyu: The most difficult challenges on CodeWars, often involving highly complex algorithms and problem-solving skills. 👿

## Folder Structure

The solutions folders in this repository are organized based on the Kyu ratings. Each folder contains the solutions to challenges of that particular Kyu rating. Please navigate to the corresponding folder to access the solutions you are interested in.
